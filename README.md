# ZeroOneFlow
This is the repository of [ZeroOne Flow](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/zeroone-flow/id1563516711) app.

## Concept
A digital art of flowing binary numbers. Zero and One will vividly flow on the screen. Please enjoy the dynamic beauty of 01!

Zero and one are the minimum elements to reveal the ultimate beauty of the whole digital world.
It's easy to recognize, but truly hard to understand.
You can try to find anything meaningful in the endless flow, though I don't assure that is not a waste of time.
The art is various, the truth always turns out to be zero and one.
